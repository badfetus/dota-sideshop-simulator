# Dota Side Shop Simulator

This code is to simulate the results of various strategies that can be used in the Dota 2 Side Shop from the 2020 TI Battle Pass.
The side shop is a mini game where you spend the gold you obtain from doing various Battle Pass related things via buying heroes from a random selection.
3 of the same hero combines into an upgraded version of the hero and 3 of the upgraded hero combines into the most upgraded version of this hero.
These heroes can be sold at any stage (including the beginning stage) for various rewards.

The model and it's results explained more in-depth [can be found here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/hxrmga/i_made_a_tool_to_simulate_dota_2_sideshop/)
